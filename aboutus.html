        Located in downtown Pasadena, Rosebud Movie Posters has one of the country's largest collections of movie posters and movie memorabilia.  In 1965 its owners, Thomas and Wilson Chatterly, began selling movie collectibles out of their garage.  By 1978 they had already amassed over 100,000 pieces, and decided to relocate to the Warehouse District, where they opened what would become Rosebud's home for the following 20 years.  Today customers can choose from over 2 million collectibles, ranging from film posters and stills to set props and scripts.  Rosebud ships globally and adds daily to its massive collection.

        In 1998 we moved to our current location at 91 Wall Street (the sign hasn't changed!).  Parking is located on the north side of the building directly across from B. Dalton Bookseller.
